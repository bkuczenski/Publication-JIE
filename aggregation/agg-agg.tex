\subsection{Foreground Aggregation}

Often the contents of the foreground


These vectors summarize the contents of the foreground without disclosing its detailed structure.  The aggregated dependency vector $\tilde{\mathbf{a}}_d$ has the same dimension as the background database, and the aggregated emission vector $\tilde{\mathbf{b}}_f $has the same dimension as the elementary flow matrix.  The dependency vector can be transformed into an elementary flow vector by multiplying by $B_x$.  The result of the study $s$ is the sum of foreground and background impact scores:

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rl}
   \tilde{\mathbf{b}} & = \tilde{\mathbf{b}}_f + \tilde{\mathbf{b}}_x \\
   s &= \mathbf{e}^T \times \tilde{\mathbf{b}} \\
   & = \mathbf{e}^T \times \tilde{\mathbf{b}}_f + \mathbf{e}^T \times \tilde{\mathbf{b}}_x \\
   &= \tilde{s}_f + \tilde{s}_x
\end{array}
\label{eqn:lci}
\end{equation}
