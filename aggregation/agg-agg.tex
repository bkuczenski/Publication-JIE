\subsection{Foreground Aggregation}

Often the contents of the foreground

An important intermediate result is the vector of activity levels for the foreground nodes $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$, also visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:foreground}:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{x}} = (I - A_f)^{-1} \times \tilde{\mathbf{y}}
\label{eqn:inv}
\end{equation}
This vector can be used to describe an \emph{aggregated foreground}, which generates the same results as the fully expanded foreground:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rl}
    \tilde{\mathbf{b}}_f & = B_f \times \tilde{\mathbf{x}} \\
    \tilde{\mathbf{a}}_d & = A_d \times \tilde{\mathbf{x}} \\
    \tilde{\mathbf{b}}_x & = B_x \times \tilde{\mathbf{a}}_d
\end{array}
\label{eqn:agg}
\end{equation}

These vectors summarize the contents of the foreground without disclosing its detailed structure.  The aggregated dependency vector $\tilde{\mathbf{a}}_d$ has the same dimension as the background database, and the aggregated emission vector $\tilde{\mathbf{b}}_f $has the same dimension as the elementary flow matrix.  The dependency vector can be transformed into an elementary flow vector by multiplying by $B_x$.  The result of the study $s$ is the sum of foreground and background impact scores:

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rl}
   \tilde{\mathbf{b}} & = \tilde{\mathbf{b}}_f + \tilde{\mathbf{b}}_x \\
   s &= \mathbf{e}^T \times \tilde{\mathbf{b}} \\
   & = \mathbf{e}^T \times \tilde{\mathbf{b}}_f + \mathbf{e}^T \times \tilde{\mathbf{b}}_x \\
   &= \tilde{s}_f + \tilde{s}_x
\end{array}
\label{eqn:lci}
\end{equation}

The nodes that make up the foreground of an LCA study describe an implicit system boundary
