OK, finished with GMB paper.  Now I understand (a) his 3-dimensional production recipe matrices (Z) and (b) the basic strategy for modeling different allocation treatments (partitioning; classical system expansion; alternate activity allocation; product substitution allocation).  

I should write a new supplemental section that does not wholeheartedly invoke GMB's cumbersome notation, but instead endorses his general approach, and show how each approach could be conceived in a foreground model consisting of just the multifunctional process.

Then I only need to make minor adjustments to the main text to refer to the section.
