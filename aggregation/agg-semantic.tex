\subsection{Stable Semantic References to Study Elements}

In practice, while it is easy to reproduce a set of sparse matrices, there is considerable potential for ambiguity
in identifying the background datasets and emissions to which those matrix entries correspond.
In order to achieve the transparency and reproducibility promised by this disclosure framework, it must be possible for study authors and readers to agree on the meaning of those references.  In particular, the database configuration, dataset version, reference flow and dimension (quantitative unit of measure) must be unambiguous and easy to interpret.

Agreement about the meaning of concepts is often accomplished using linked semantic data \citep{Bizer_2009}, in which an object to be interpreted is signified by a link to a resource on the World Wide Web, typically referred to as a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) or a hyperlink.  The resource at the end of the link functions as a point of agreement: both study author and data user can follow it from anywhere on the Internet to obtain the same information.  The content pointed to by the hyperlink, along with context provided by \emph{other} references to the same content, gives meaning to the information and allows it to be curated by the study authors and other members of the community \citep{Khan_2011}.   Semantic data are structured by reference to knowledge models called ontologies, which describe the relationships among different types of entities \citep{Madin2008}.  Some preliminary descriptions of the entity types involved in LCA computation, and their relationships to one another, have recently been developed \citep{Ciroth_Srocka_2014, Janowicz_WOP_2015, Kuczenski_JCP_2016}.

Before the goal of easily reproducible foreground models can be realized, the linked data foundation must be laid.  Background database providers should ensure that their users have access to \emph{stable semantic references} for publicly available datasets that denote a particular activity in a particular database version and configuration.  These references should take the form of URIs that can be accessed using any Internet browser and can provide both author and reader with documentary information describing the referred dataset, the available reference flows and their dimensions, and a mechanism for the reader to obtain access to the exchange data or LCI/LCIA computations for the purposes of model validation.  A dependency reference in disclosure item~\ref{itm:bg} should include both an activity and a reference flow.

Similarly, LCIA method providers should ensure that their methods make use of stable semantic references to elementary flows and contexts.  Current research has revealed widespread challenges to finding consistency on the identities of elementary flows despite the community's longstanding awareness of the problem, and several mutually inconsistent reference flow sets exist \citep{Edelen_2017}.  The conventional understanding of a ``flow'' as comprising a substance and a context together (e.g. methane, emissions to air) causes a combinatorial increase in the number of flows in a database, and also multiplies the potential points of disagreement across sources.  I reiterate Edelen et al.'s (ibid.) suggestion to explicitly regard substances (which can easily include non-material ``flowables'' such as land occupation and transformation) and contexts as independent semantic classes.  In this case, an elementary flow entry in the disclosure item~\ref{itm:em} would require both a flowable and a context.

It is necessary for the entries in disclosure items~\ref{itm:bg} and \ref{itm:em} to be unambiguous and easy to interpret.  Entries in \ref{itm:bg}, which represent rows in $A_d$, must clearly identify the originating database, version, and configuration, along with the precise dataset, that dataset's reference flow, and the dimension (reference quantity or unit) of that flow.  In addition, the sign of the numeric entry in $A_d$ must be consistent with the implementation of the background dataset.  Similar requirements also hold for entries in \ref{itm:em}, which represent rows in $B_f$.
