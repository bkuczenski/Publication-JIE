\input{fig_fragments}

Figure~\ref{fig:fragments} illustrates the structure of some basic foreground configurations.  Most product system models would include many of these elements mixed together.  
The first (a) is a sequential model, in which each node requires one foreground input and generates one output. This model is equivalent to a ``gate to gate'' model.  Here the weights $k_i$ indicate the amount of the preceding reference flow that is required by the subsequent node.  Figure~\ref{fig:fragments}(b) shows an additive model, in which the outputs of several foreground nodes are added together, equivalent to a ``mixer'' or a horizontal average.  In this arrangement the weights %represent the relative weights of each input, and
should add up to a unit output of the reference node.  Finally, Figure~\ref{fig:fragments}(c) shows a foreground model with a cyclic dependency, where some of the reference output is consumed by another foreground node.

A typical PSM may contain multiple modules or fragments that are interconnected.  An example of foreground composed of several fragments is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:fragments}(d).  Here, the nodes labeled 1--5 represent one fragment, which generates the foreground's canonical reference flow $\tilde{y}$. This fragment requires two interior flows from separate fragments ($y_0$ and $y_1$), and has two unconnected flows (4 and 5).  The reference $y_0$ is supplied by a second fragment, made up of nodes 6-8.  The reference $y_1$ is supplied by another fragment made of only one node (9). The reference flow $y_1$ is consumed in two different places by the other fragments.

As noted, a reviewer with access to items \ref{itm:fg} and \ref{itm:af} in the disclosure would be able to construct $A_f$ and automatically create a process-flow diagram, annotated with information about each node.
