Let's just revisit the review comments:

R1- [Suh] math complaints. 

Fair enough. Take out the Heijungs formulation and just stick to the IO model. Clean up the equations where indicated.



R2- [Pauliuk] complimentary. talk more about practical issues and less about technical issues.



R3- [???] confidentiality.  elevate privacy discussion? that would be a major rewrite-- and would thus qualify the paper for resubmission
Discuss critical review more. this is key.

ok. some thoughts to think about.
