oy oy oy.

The new plan is to reconceptualize the paper about "Structured aggregation" instead of "structured publication." That is a more minimal publishable unit. Then I will be able to excise roughly half the discussion content.

So, let's get started.

Let's just revisit the review comments:

R1- [Suh] math complaints. 

Fair enough. Take out the Heijungs formulation and just stick to the IO model. Clean up the equations where indicated.



R2- [Pauliuk] complimentary. talk more about practical issues and less about technical issues.



R3- [???] confidentiality.  elevate privacy discussion? that would be a major rewrite-- and would thus qualify the paper for resubmission
Discuss critical review more. this is key.

ok. some thoughts to think about.

Today I again have an abbreviated hour because of a phone call at 11.  But 40 minutes is better than 18 minutes.  and the point of the background project is to make routine incremental progress.

So the broad plan is :

 (a) clean up the math.  Possibly introduce something specific about privacy
 (b) choose a section to move out of the main paper completely
 (c) move back in the SI discussion about different aggregation forms

Now we will re-read the comments and the paper, starting with R3.

next I will quick-read the paper to find text that pokes out to be moved or reclassified.
