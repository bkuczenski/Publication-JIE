Changes that should be made to the revision:

 * 2.2 p.7 line 26-30. Make Pauliuk's recommended citation change

 * 2.3 p.10 line 9Reference to Gibon et al 2015 should be replaced with a methodological reference, probably Suh 2004

 * 2.4 p.12 line 3-8.  items d-ii and d-iii.  emphasize that only rows containing non-zero entries should be listed

 * 4.1.5 p.17 line 54-56 again emphasize current practice; clarify distinction between fig. 3e and fig. 3f

 * 5.1 p.20 line 32-34 "background database choice, dataset selection, and version information CAN ALL BE made available"

 * 5.2 p.21 line 15-17 two separate sentences.  (1) the reviewer must confirm eq.9 and b_priv are correct and valid. (2) therefore reviewer needs privileged access

 * Conclusion: reiterate "formal definition of scope + system boundary"
