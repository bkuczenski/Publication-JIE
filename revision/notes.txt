Page/word count audit

Section 1: 2.5 pages, 869 words
Section 2: 11 pages, ~3300 words, 3 figures, lots of equations
Section 3: 2.5 pages, 807 words, 2 tables
Section 4: 5- pages, 1508 words
Section 5: 1+ page, 424 words

Supplementary Section 2: 3 pages, 845 words, 1 figure

I maybe want to move the examples into SI?  need to get the examples running again, and that means migrating lca-matrix stuff. and engaging with the current tabular stuff.

[and wasn't there supposed to be an antelope paper this summer? to say nothing of an antelope server??]

Pauliuk's critique is substantial and his requests are demanding.

He wants LESS OF:

 - discussion about structuring data
 - 

he wants MORE OF:

 - aggregation forms
 - version control
 - reference product designation / "matching"
 - which results can be produced from which aggregation level
 - consequences for data providers, data users, db providers, software developers

I am beginning to think the paper needs to be split in two-- one about formulating LCA foreground studies, and the other about structured publication

that is a depressing finding, because it increases the amount of work I do by about a factor of 10.

But let's look it over. We could bring back the aggregation forms, and talk about private data, and talk about multioutput processes + allocation, and keep the examples, if we carved out -- well, if we carved out the heart of the paper and put it into a new paper.  Specifically: 
"Requirements for structured publication..."
"Publishing a foreground model"
and the whole discussion

so then, what is the point of the paper?  

The first is to represent studies in a structured way; the second is to publish them in a reproducible way.

to represent different aggregation forms, and to particularly focus on private results and allocations. I would really like to show how multioutput processes can be split up explicitly.
for this I should follow Pauliuk's referral...

And that just leaads to M-B 2014, which I don't want to get into. Fine to keep the allocation commentary as it is and simply make consistency with Stefan's recommendations.

The only way to go forward on this is to actually start revising the paper and bring the aggregation section back in from the SI.
ok, later.
