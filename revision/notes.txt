Page/word count audit

Section 1: 2.5 pages, 869 words
Section 2: 11 pages, ~3300 words, 3 figures, lots of equations
Section 3: 2.5 pages, 807 words, 2 tables
Section 4: 5- pages, 1508 words
Section 5: 1+ page, 424 words

Supplementary Section 2: 3 pages, 845 words, 1 figure

I maybe want to move the examples into SI?  need to get the examples running again, and that means migrating lca-matrix stuff. and engaging with the current tabular stuff.

[and wasn't there supposed to be an antelope paper this summer? to say nothing of an antelope server??]

Pauliuk's critique is substantial and his requests are demanding.

He wants LESS OF:

 - discussion about structuring data
 - 

he wants MORE OF:

 - aggregation forms
 - version control
 - reference product designation / "matching"
 - which results can be produced from which aggregation level
 - consequences for data providers, data users, db providers, software developers

I am beginning to think the paper needs to be split in two-- one about formulating LCA foreground studies, and the other about structured publication

that is a depressing finding, because it increases the amount of work I do by about a factor of 10.

But let's look it over. We could bring back the aggregation forms, and talk about private data, and talk about multioutput processes + allocation, and keep the examples, if we carved out -- well, if we carved out the heart of the paper and put it into a new paper.  Specifically: 
"Requirements for structured publication..."
"Publishing a foreground model"
and the whole discussion

so then, what is the point of the paper?  

The first is to represent studies in a structured way; the second is to publish them in a reproducible way.

to represent different aggregation forms, and to particularly focus on private results and allocations. I would really like to show how multioutput processes can be split up explicitly.
for this I should follow Pauliuk's referral...

And that just leaads to M-B 2014, which I don't want to get into. Fine to keep the allocation commentary as it is and simply make consistency with Stefan's recommendations.

The only way to go forward on this is to actually start revising the paper and bring the aggregation section back in from the SI.
ok, later.

What does the paper need to do?  Recap after audio-recording thoughts. (6:30)

 - Introduction: Problematize the state of affairs: unreproducible, unreviewable LCA

 - Objectives: what problem should structured aggregation solve?

   * We need to be able to precisely describe our models
     = we need to precisely state the scope of the model
     = we need to say how different nodes are connected-- how different flows are terminated
     = we need to say what inventory data are used for each node

   * We need to do so without having to reproduce background databases which are (a) very large and (b) proprietary
     = however, we are using those background databases so we need to refer to them

   * We need to be able to conceal parts of the models that would expose confidential information
     = aggregation is commonly used for this purpose (as documented) but it is not usually done in a transparent way (even if the transparency is only internal)

   * We need to be able to disclose modelling details that are required to evaluate the quality of the study
     = critical review usually focuses on the report, but the results are generated from the model
     = adaptation and extension of studies is similar to review, except more intensive because the model must be reproduced
     = During review or adaptation, lacking a formal description of the model being adapted, a data user will need to intensively interpret the written report, which is costly and error prone.
     = meta-analysis is the same




 - Approach:
   1. Define aggregation, making reference to the classical (graph / Peters 2007) formulation and using Fig 1
   2. Lay out foreground aggregation (Fig 2)- improvement because of concision
   3. Talk about aggregation forms (Fig S1)
   4. Present private aggregation (new figure)
  
 - Discussion
